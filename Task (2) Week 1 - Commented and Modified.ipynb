Project Summary and Analysis
1. Data Import and Analysis:
Data Import: The dataset was loaded from a CSV file using the pandas library.
Data Conversion: The values in the TrafficIndexLive column were converted to numeric values using pd.to_numeric to ensure there were no errors.
Extracting Numeric Columns: Only numeric columns were extracted from the data to create a correlation matrix.
2. Creating Visualizations:
Scatter Plot: Created a scatter plot to show the relationship between TrafficIndexLive and TrafficIndexWeekAgo.
KDE Plot: Created a KDE plot to show the distribution of TrafficIndexLive with differentiation based on TrafficIndexWeekAgo.
Bar Plot: Created a bar plot to show the distribution of TrafficIndexWeekAgo across different cities.
Heatmap: Created a heatmap to show the correlation matrix between numeric columns.
Box Plot: Created a box plot to show the distribution of TrafficIndexLive across different cities.
Histogram: Created a histogram to show the distribution of TrafficIndexLive.
Pair Plot: Created a pair plot to show pairwise relationships between selected features.
Boxen Plot: Created a boxen plot to show the distribution of TrafficIndexWeekAgo across different cities.
Joint Plot: Created a joint plot to show the relationship between TrafficIndexLive and TrafficIndexWeekAgo.
3. Analysis of Results:
Variable Relationships: The correlation matrix was used to analyze the relationships between different variables in the data. The heatmap (Heatmap) showed the strength of the relationships between various variables.
Data Distribution: Box plots (Box Plot), histograms (Histogram), and KDE plots (KDE Plot) were used to understand the distribution of data and how it varies between different cities.
Trends and Distributions: Pair plots (Pair Plot) and joint plots (Joint Plot) showed general trends and distributions in the data, helping identify potential patterns and variations.
Benefits Gained:
Deeper Understanding of Data: The visualizations and analyses provided a deeper understanding of the relationships between different variables and the distribution of data.
Pattern Discovery: The visualizations helped discover general patterns and trends in the data, which can be useful for making informed decisions.
Improved Visual Presentation: Using the seaborn library, we created attractive visualizations that make it easier to understand and analyze the data.
Future Steps:
More Detailed Analysis: Conducting more detailed analysis using advanced statistical tools and methods.
Expanding the Dataset: Collecting and analyzing additional data can provide deeper insights.
Applying Machine Learning: Implementing machine learning techniques to predict future trends based on current data.
